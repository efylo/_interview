# 32-bit and 64-bit OS

## Abstract

32-bit and 64-bit refers the size of a CPU register. 32-bit register means that the computer can store maximum 32-bit size addresses, which is about 4GB size. If you use 64-bit processor, then you are able to store maximum 2^64^ bit size of addresses, which is quite astronomical. So, practically there exist no limitations upon representing virtual address if you use 64-bit processor, and it has advantages in multi-tasking.

Though, the number of computations per second are greater in 32-bit OS. So many 64-bit processors come in multiple cores. 

A computer with 64-bit processor can run 32-bit or 64-bit OS. But 64-bit processor cannot run 16-bit legacy program, so some old 32-bit programs will not work on 64-bit processors.

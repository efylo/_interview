# BST and Hash Table

## Abstract

Hash table shows better performance in search, insert, and delete over BST. 

---

## BST

- Time complexity: O(log n)
  - logarithmic time guaranteed
- easy implementation, user-defined modification possible
- ease in sort, ranged search, ordering

---

## Hash Table

- Time complexity: constant time(average)
  - constant time not guaranteed
- hard implementation (generally built-in)
- sort, ranged search, ordering needs extra effort

# Handshaking Lemma

## Terms

- Vertices - plural form of vertex, nodes
- Edges - lines that connect two vertices, nodes
- Undirected graph - graph with edges that have no directions
- Degree - the number of edges of the node(vertex)
- Odd nodes(vertices) - nodes(vertices) of odd degree

---

## Definition

in every finite undirected graph, there are even number of odd nodes(vertices).

such that, the sum of degree of all nodes are even numbers.

in directed graphs, the sum of in-degrees and out-degrees both equal to the number of edges

here, in-degree is the number of incoming edges, out-degree is the number of out-going edges

lemma also fits to (finite families of sets,) multigraphs

## Review

Not sure how this fits to algorithms

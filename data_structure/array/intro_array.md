# Intro to Arrays(배열)

---

## Definition(정의)

- a collection of items, they are stored at contiguous memory locations
- the idea came from storing multiple items of same type together
- ease in calculating the position of each element

---

## Characteristic(특성)

- static allocation, fixed size - allocated in compile-time
- indexing - zero-based, one-based, n-based

---

## Advantages(장점)

- random access to elements - access time of the element is equivalent
- better cache locality - performance improvement
- represent multiple items of the same type in a single name

---

## Disadvantages(단점)

- you can't change the size - due to static memory allocation
- insertion and deletion are difficult, shifting operation costly

---

## Applications(응용)

- stores data elements of the same data type
- used for CPU scheduling
- implement other data structures - stacks, queues, heaps, hash tables, etc.
